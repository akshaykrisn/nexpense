### Power Supply

For the internal components of a computer, a power supply unit (PSU) transforms mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power. The power supply transforms alternating current (AC) from 110-115 or 220-230 volts into a constant low-voltage DC (direct current) that the computer may use and is rated by the amount of watts it generates.

The power supply is normally found near the top of the computer, at the back.

The make and model can differ depending on the requirement the system has.

### Heat Sink & Fan

A heat sink and fan is a heat exchanger that transfers heat created by a computer to a fluid medium, typically air or a liquid coolant, where it is dispersed away from the device, allowing temperature management. Heat sinks are used in computers to keep CPUs, GPUs, and some chipsets and RAM modules cool. Heat sinks are used with high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and LEDs, where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.

Heat sinks are customized as per the make of a computer.

### Video Adapter Card/Graphics Card

![https://static.techspot.com/images/products/2019/graphics-cards/org/2019-02-22-product-6.jpg](https://static.techspot.com/images/products/2019/graphics-cards/org/2019-02-22-product-6.jpg)

Video adapter/graphics card is an expansion card that can provide output images for display devices. These are discrete graphics cards or dedicated graphics cards, which emphasizes the difference between these graphics cards and integrated graphics cards. The core of both is the graphics processing unit (GPU). 

The video adapter is a circuit board connected to a personal computer to provide display functions. In graphics mode, the monitor can display any bitmap image. In text and graphics modes, some displays also provide resolution options.

The particular model is **Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660Ti**

### Network Interface Controller

A network interface controller (NIC) is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network. 

The network controller uses specific standards at the physical layer and data link layer (such as Ethernet) to implement the electronic circuits required for communication. This provides the basis for a complete network protocol stack that supports communication between computers on the same local area network (LAN) and large-area network communication using routable protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP).

### Wireless Network Interface Controller

![https://www.powerplanetonline.com/cdnassets/tl_wn881nd_002_l.jpg](https://www.powerplanetonline.com/cdnassets/tl_wn881nd_002_l.jpg)

A wireless network interface controller (WNIC) is a network interface controller that connects to a wireless network like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth instead of a wired network like Token Ring or Ethernet. A WNIC, like other NICs, communicates over radio waves using an antenna and layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.

A wireless network interface controller may be implemented as an expansion card and connected using PCI bus or PCIe bus, or connected via USB, PC Card, ExpressCard, Mini PCIe or M.2.

The term is usually applied to IEEE 802.11 adapters; it may also apply to a NIC using protocols other than 802.11, such as one implementing Bluetooth connections.

The WNIC in the image is **TP-Link 300 MBPS PCI Express**

### Optical Drive

The optical drive is a computer hardware, the size of a thick soft cover book. There is a small open/close button on the front to eject and retract the drive bay door. This is how media such as CDs, DVDs, and BDs are inserted and removed from the drive.

Optical drives retrieve and/or store data on optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and BDs (Blu-ray discs).

The optical drive normally goes by other names like a disc drive, ODD (abbreviation), CD drive, DVD drive, or BD drive.

### Floppy Disk

![https://static.javatpoint.com/computer/images/what-is-a-floppy-disk.png](https://static.javatpoint.com/computer/images/what-is-a-floppy-disk.png)

Floppy disk or floppy disk is a kind of disk storage, which consists of a thin and flexible magnetic storage medium plate placed in a square or almost square plastic shell. The plastic shell is lined with fabric to remove dust particles on the rotating disk. The floppy disk is read and written by the floppy disk drive.

IBM first introduced it as a 8-in diskette in 1971. In the middle of 1970s, a 5.25 diskette was introduced.

### Hard Drive

A hard disk drive (HDD) is an electromechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage and one or more rigid, fast-rotating platters coated with magnetic materials to store and retrieve digital data. The magnetic disk cooperates with the magnetic head and is usually mounted on a movable actuator arm to read and write data on the surface of the magnetic disk. The access to the data is random, which means that individual data blocks can be saved and recalled in any order. HDD is a non-volatile memory that retains stored data even when the device is turned off. Modern HDDs are usually in the shape of small rectangular boxes.

### SATA Cable

Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) are used to connect devices in computer cable assemblies, such as storage devices.

The SATA technology itself is a connecter interface primarily used for computer bus connections in storage applications. In this application, the cables are used to connect a mass storage device (e.g. hard disk drives, optical drives, solid-state memory drives) to a host bus adapter such as a motherboard.

### Motherboard

![https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/motherboard-small.jpg](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/motherboard-small.jpg)

The motherboard provides connections between computer hardware components, such as the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and graphics card. There are many types of motherboards designed for different types and sizes of computers.
Each type of motherboard is designed to work with certain types of processors and memory, so they will not work with every type of processor or memory. However, hard drives are mostly universal and can be used with most motherboards, regardless of their type or brand.

A computer motherboard is located inside the computer case and is where most of the parts and computer peripherals connect. With tower computers, the motherboard is on the left or right side of the tower and is the biggest circuit board.

### PATA Cable

![https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/2e/0e/a52e0ee8a754b2f5740387dd6b72ef62.png](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/2e/0e/a52e0ee8a754b2f5740387dd6b72ef62.png)

PATA cables are flat cables with 40-pin connectors (in a 20x2 matrix) on either side of the cable.

One end of the cable plugs into a port on the motherboard, usually labeled IDE, and the other into the back of a storage device like a hard drive.

PATA cables come in 40-wire or 80-wire designs. Newer PATA storage devices require the use of the more capable 80-wire cable to meet certain speed requirements. Both types have 40-pins and look nearly identical, so telling them apart can be difficult. Although usually, the connectors on an 80-wire cable will be black, gray, and blue while 40-wire cable connectors will only be black.

### RAM

RAM is temporary storage that goes away when the power turns off. Itâ€™s very fast, which makes it ideal for things the computer is actively working on, such as applications that are currently running and the data those applications work on or with.

Random-access memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
